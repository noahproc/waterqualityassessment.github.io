# Water Quality Metadata Analysis
Programmed during the summer of 2025, I developed a passion project that analyzed water quality date for my home county, Erie County, OH. I used Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to code bar/pie charts, and develop a metadata algorithm to great a ranking system. This was a full stack project, as I coded a website to house the results of the project.

**Final Results**

*Ranking:* 5/5

*Total Score:* 85/100
